    "Consider an array $A=[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$ containing $n$ elements. The only operation you are allowed is to check whether two elements are equal, i.e. \"is $a_i$ equal to $a_j$?\" and these will be the elementary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, assume that $n$ is a power of 2, i.e. $n=2^k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An element $x$ is the *majority* element in $A$ if it occurs more than $n/2$ times in the array. So for example, $[1,2,1,1]$ (with $n=4$) has a majority element 1 because it occurs $3>n/2$ times. The array $[1,2,3,3]$ has no majority element: 3 occurs twice, but this isn't enough because it is not true that $2>n/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider two distinct algorithms for finding the majority element in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Let us first start with a naive approach. Describe, in words, what the different steps of the following algorithm do and derive the complexity of this algorithm in terms of elementary operations. **[ 5 ]**\n",

    "**(b)** Derive in words or using pseudocode, a divide-and-conquer recursive algorithm for finding the majority element in $A$. **[ 10 ]**\n",

    "> Hint: You need to distinguish a number of scenarios depending on whether there is a majority element in the first and/or second array of the divide-and-conquer procedure.\n",
