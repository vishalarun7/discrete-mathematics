# Discrete Mathematics classes

Class notebooks for Imperial College ELEC50006 by Dan Goodman.

My recommended way of running code is to use Google Colab with a Google account (links below). Other good options are running locally with Jupyter notebook server or VSCode (instructions below for Python) or [Replit](https://replit.com/).

## Week by week

### Week 1. Intro and Fibonacci.

## Installing Python locally

If you're comfortable with Python, you can install and run Python locally. My recommended technique is as follows:

Firstly, install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Python 3.

Next, set up Conda to use ``conda-forge`` for binary distributions, by running this at the terminal.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge 
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
conda create --name dmclass python=3 jupyter matplotlib numpy scipy networkx
```

## Running local Jupyter notebook server

Now activate the environment and run the Jupyter server in the directory where you downloaded the notebooks or cloned the repository.

```
conda activate dmclass
jupyter notebook
```

## Running via VSCode

Install Python as above and [follow the instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
